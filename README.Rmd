The `creditCardTool` package provides helper functions for analyzing credit card default data,
including data cleaning, splitting, visualization, and summarization.

It is designed to support modular, reusable components of a typical data science pipeline.


## Installation

You can install the development version of creditCardTool from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("DSCI-310-2025/creditCardTool")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```r
library(creditCardTool)

# Basic example
split <- split_data(data.frame(x = 1:100), train_size = 0.8)
plot <- make_target_plot(data.frame(default_payment_next_month = c(0, 1, 0, 1)))
```

## Functions

- `split_data()` — Splits a dataset into training and test sets
- `make_target_plot()` — Visualizes the distribution of default payments
- `make_scatter_facet_plot()` — Plots numeric features against default status
- `clean_column_names()` — Standardizes column names to snake_case
- `compute_avg_amounts()` — Computes average billing/payment values per row
